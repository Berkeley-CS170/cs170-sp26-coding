    "\n",
    "The edit distance problem finds the minimal number of insertions, deletions and substitutions of characters required to transform one word into another. A big application of this problem is finding the global alignment between two strings, which is often used in computational biology. \n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the textbook https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf#page=6.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A natural measure of the distance between two strings is the extent to which they can be aligned, or matched up. Technically, an alignment is simply a way of writing the strings one above the other. For instance, here are two possible alignments of SNOWY and SUNNY:\n",
    "\n",
    ">    S−NOWY  |  −SNOW−Y <br />\n",
    ">    SUNN−Y   &nbsp;|  SUN−−NY <br />\n",
    ">    Cost: 3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Cost: 5\n",
    "\n",
    ">The “−” indicates a “gap”; any number of these can be placed in either string. The cost of an alignment is the number of columns in which the letters differ. And\n",
    ">the edit distance between two strings is the cost of their best possible alignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will implement an algorithm to compute the alignment between two strings $x$ and $y$, specifically, your algorithm should return the global alignment (as shown above), not just an integer value denoting the edit distance. "

See https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf#page=9. On this DAG, the DP algorithm finds the shortest path from `(0,0)` to `(n,m)`. The length of the shortest path is our edit distance, and the edges in the path correspond to the global alignment. In our back tracking algorithm, we start at `(n,m)` and reconstruct the shortest path to `(0,0)`. Since we start with `(n,m)` and end at `(0,0)`, we are back tracking the computations we did in step 1, hence the name. \n",

    "Since we know how to translate edges into global alignment, we now want to reconstruct the actual path from `(n,m)` to `(0,0)`. If an edge `(a,b)->(c,d)` is part of the shortest path, this means the subproblem `(a,b)` was used to compute the solution to `(c,d)`. For the edit distance problem, we know that the subproblem `(i,j)` is computed from the either `(i-1,j)`, `(i,j-1)`, or `(i-1,j-1)`. Therefore, if the node `(i,j)` is visited in the shortest path, then one of the edges `(i-1,j)->(i,j)`, `(i,j-1)->(i,j)`, or `(i-1,j-1)->(i,j)` is in the shortest path. \n",

This means that at least one of the three values `dp[i - 1][j] + 1`, `dp[i][j - 1] + 1`, or `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + diff(i,j)` must equal `dp[i][j]`.
